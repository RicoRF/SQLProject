# GameUR Database Project

This project is part of the DATA1025 course, focusing on developing a database solution for GameUR, a startup providing a GAME kiosk service in Fredericton. GameUR rents out copies of games to its members and requires a structured database to manage memberships, rentals, game inventory, and transactional records. 

## Project Structure

This repository includes:
- SQL files containing DDL and DML statements for setting up the database and populating it with sample data.
- Stored procedures and triggers to implement business rules and handle specific database operations.
- Test scripts to validate the functionality of each SQL command, procedure, and trigger.

## Requirements

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Database Setup and Basic Queries
- **Table Creation**: Implement table structures for entities such as `Membership`, `Rental`, `DetailRental`, `GameCopy`, `Game`, and `Price`, based on the E-R Diagram.
- **Constraints**: Define primary keys, foreign keys, and specific constraints:
  - `Membership`: Balance â‰¥ 0, no null values in Member Number, First, and Last Names.
  - `Rental`: All attributes are non-null.
  - `DetailRental`: All attributes are non-null except Return Date.
  - `GameCopy`, `Game`, and `Price`: Non-null attributes, with business rules on attributes like `Rent Fee` and `Daily Late Fee`.
- **Data Insertion**: Populate tables with sample data provided.
- **Data Manipulation**: Implement commands for updating and saving records in tables (`Game`, `Price`, etc.).
- **Queries**: Develop complex SQL queries for data retrieval based on conditions (e.g., games with costs above their genre's average cost, games rented on or before the due date, membership information).

### Part 2: Advanced Operations
- **Table Alterations**: Add new attributes such as `DAYS_LATE` in `DetailRental` and `GA_STATUS` in `GameCopy`, with specific constraints.
- **Updates and Constraints**: Implement updates using subqueries and enforce value constraints for new columns.
- **Stored Procedures**:
  - **PRC_ADD_GAMECOPY**: Adds new game copies, validating existence and status.
  - **PRC_MEM_INFO**: Displays a member's info based on membership number.
  - **PRC_NEW_RENTAL**: Creates new rental records.
  - **PRC_NEW_DETAIL** and **PRC_NEW_DETAIL_V2**: Manages rentals and rental details, including multi-game rentals.
  - **PRC_RETURN_GAME**: Records game returns and updates relevant statuses.
- **Triggers**:
  - **TRG_LATE_RETURN**: Calculates days late when games are returned, updating `DAYS_LATE` accordingly.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RicoRF/SQLProject.git
   cd GameUR-Database-Project
   ```

2. Execute the SQL scripts in the following order:
   - `part1_setup.sql`: Initializes tables, constraints, and inserts sample data.
   - `part1_queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries specified in Part 1 requirements.
   - `part2_operations.sql`: Executes table alterations, stored procedures, and triggers.

3. Test the procedures and triggers by running `part2_tests.sql`, which includes validation for all scenarios specified in the requirements.

## Usage

- **Setup and Data Insertion**: Use `part1_setup.sql` to create tables and populate data.
- **Advanced Functionality**: Execute `part2_operations.sql` for adding business rules, stored procedures, and triggers.
- **Testing**: Run `part2_tests.sql` to verify procedures, validate conditions, and simulate sample transactions.

## Sample Screens and Results

Refer to the documentation for example output screens for procedures like `PRC_MEM_INFO`, `PRC_NEW_DETAIL`, and `PRC_RETURN_GAME`. These samples will guide you through expected outputs.
